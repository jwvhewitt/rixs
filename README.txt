Rixs is an action platformer game made with roguelike tiles. To play it you
will need Python and PyGame installed; run the file "main.py".

Use the arrow keys to move, and the space bar to attack.


* What's the deal with the name?

 I originally wanted to call the game "Realm", but there was an action platformer
 for the SNES by that name. So, checking wiktionary, I found this reconstructed
 proto-celtic ancestor of the word. It looked to me like one of those
 unpronouncible names from a 90s computer game, so it stuck.

 No idea how it's supposed to be pronounced, but "rik-sys" seems to be popular.
